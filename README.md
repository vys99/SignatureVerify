# Signature Verification Project

This project aims to build a deep learning model for verifying handwritten signatures using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The model is trained to classify whether a given signature is genuine or fake based on image data.

# Dataset

The dataset contains images of genuine and forged signatures. Each signature image is preprocessed and converted into a grayscale or binary format, and resized for input to the CNN model.

# Libraries Used

OpenCV
matplotlib
numpy
Scikit-learn
pickle
tensorflow
